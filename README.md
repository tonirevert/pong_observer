PONG game using javascript and nodeJS with require
==================================================

We are going to implement PONG. First console game in history
Take a look at http://www.ponggame.org/

In order to run for first time the project , you should:

1. Run `npm install` in the provided sample code
2. Start gulp using `./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js watch` (with this task executed, every time we do a change on every single script inside javascript folder this is automatically reflected on bin/main.js the only javascript file included in our deployed webapp project )


```

Note that every time we change any .js and we don't have watch gulp task on execution we should "transpile" using:

frontend$ ./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js browserify

Result will be  bin/index.js file embedding all project .js

We are using nodeJS ecosystem in this project in an unusual way. Only for client
web development. Uning requirejs module to be able to architect our project in a more
scalable way.
